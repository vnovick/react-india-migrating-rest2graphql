# Exercise 1 - exploring project REST api

#### Background

- main entry point to our node api server is `api/app.js`.
- main REST API endpoint is `http://localhost:3001/api`
- our REST API is using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
  to generate all mocked REST CRUD endpoints from `api/db.json`

#### Instructions

In this exercise you are not required to make any changes to the files, but more
exploring how you can use current REST api.

Start both
[frontend and our api server](https://github.com/vnovick/moving-from-rest-to-graphql#setup)
if you haven't done that yet.

- Browse the page on `localhost:3000` for our frontend app.
- Notice how much requests are sent to the server by opening Dev Tools.
- Execute same requests in Postman.
