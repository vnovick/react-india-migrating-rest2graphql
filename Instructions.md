# Exercise 8 - Implement Mutations and Input types

## Background

```sh
cd api
npm install
```

#### Files

These files should be modified during exercise. They also include **TODO**
comments for your convenience

- `app.js`
- `data/postsJsonDataSource.js`
- `typeDefs/types/postType.js`
- `types/mutation.js`
- `resolvers/postsResolvers.js`
- `resolvers/authorsResolvers.js`

## Instructions

In this exercise we will migrate create Mutations for creating a new user and
post.

**Steps:**

1. Define `insertAuthor` root mutation in `mutation.js` that accepts
   `AuthorInputType`
2. Create a resolver in `authorsResolvers.js` that will call
   `postsJsonAPI.insertAuthor` function
3. Implement `insertAuthor` function in `postsJsonDataSource.js`
4. Create a new root Mutation `insertPost` and configure it to accept
   `PostInputType` input type. Input type should be defined in
   `types/postType.js` and have `authorId`
5. Implement `insertPost` resolver to insert a post

## Bonus

- Configure `PostInputType` to accept `authorIdLegacy` as `Int` and change
  `postsJsonDataSource` accordingly to accommodate the change
- Configure `insertPost` mutation to accept both `authorId` or `AuthorInputType`
- Implement resolver, so we can insert both post and user in one mutation
