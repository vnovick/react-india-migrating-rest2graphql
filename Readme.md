## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below) (~5 minutes)
- [ ] üì∫ Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us/downloads) on the computer you
      will be using (~5 minutes)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v10 or greater
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

For analyzing REST API we will need [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) so
download it.

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:vnovick/moving-from-rest-to-graphql.git
```

2. Install all frontend dependencies

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Install all backend dependencies

```sh
cd api
npm install
```

## Running the app

### To get frontend app up and running

```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

### To get api server running

```sh
cd api
npm start
```

This will provide you REST backend that we will convert to GraphQL during our
workshop

## Schedule

Workshop schedule

- Logistics
- Problems with REST
- GraphQL query language
- GraphQL endpoint setup
- Design a GraphQL Schema by analyzing REST api
- Implementing temporary resolvers for Queries
- Batch REST requests with REST Data Source
- Migrate to the same data source
- Implement Mutations

## Working through the exercises

Every exercise will have a separate branch for it. You move between exercise by
changing branches.

In most exercises you will see `TODO:` comments in the code. They serve as
guidelines where you should write your solutions You will also see a list of
files that you will be required to modify. Every file will have `.final.js`
version. If you are stuck, you are welcome to peak at the final solution

## Exercise 1 - exploring project REST api
